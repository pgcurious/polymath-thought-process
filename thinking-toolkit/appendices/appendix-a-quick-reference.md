## Troubleshooting Guide

### "I'm stuck on this problem"

1. **Identify your current approach**: Which thinking type are you using?
2. **Check fit**: Is this the right type for this problem?
3. **Try a different family**:
   - Using analytical? Try creative or integrative
   - Using creative? Try analytical or strategic
   - Using one type too long? Switch deliberately

### "This seems intractable"

**Try:**
- First Principles (question all assumptions)
- Lateral Thinking (break the pattern)
- Systems Thinking (see larger context)
- Paradoxical Thinking (embrace the contradiction)

### "I have too many options"

**Use:** Convergent Thinking + Critical Thinking + Strategic Thinking
- Evaluate each option rigorously
- Apply decision criteria
- Consider long-term consequences

### "I can't think of any solutions"

**Use:** Divergent Thinking + Creative Thinking + Analogical Thinking
- Generate many possibilities without judgment
- Look to other domains for inspiration
- Combine unexpected elements

### "I don't understand this complex system"

**Use:** Systems Thinking + Visual-Spatial Thinking + Causal Thinking
- Map components and connections
- Identify feedback loops
- Trace causal chains

### "I need to explain this to others"

**Use:** Narrative Thinking + Analogical Thinking + Empathetic Thinking
- Frame as a story
- Use familiar analogies
- Consider audience perspective

## Your Personal Development Plan

### Step 1: Self-Assessment (use Chapter 41)
Rate yourself 1-5 on each thinking type

### Step 2: Identify Pattern
- Which families are strongest? Weakest?
- What's your natural preference?
- Where are the gaps?

### Step 3: Choose Focus Areas
- **Mastery** (5-7 types): Your cognitive superpowers
- **Competence** (10-15 types): Deploy when needed
- **Awareness** (all 35): Recognize when useful

### Step 4: Deliberate Practice
- **Daily**: Use one under-developed type
- **Weekly**: Combine two types from different families
- **Monthly**: Deep dive into one new type
- **Yearly**: Develop 3-5 types to next level

### Step 5: Cross-Domain Transfer
For each type, practice in 3+ domains:
- Your primary domain
- A familiar secondary domain
- An unfamiliar domain

## Remember

1. **The map is not the territory**: Real thinking is messier and more fluid
2. **Combinations are infinite**: 35 types → thousands of combinations
3. **Context matters**: Right type for right problem at right time
4. **Awareness is half the battle**: Naming what you're doing enables improvement
5. **Cross-domain is the unlock**: Same pattern, infinite applications
6. **Develop spiky profile**: Master some, competence in many, awareness of all
7. **Switch deliberately**: When stuck, consciously try a different type
8. **Teach to deepen**: Explaining types to others deepens your mastery

# Appendix D: Java Code Repository with Philosophical Commentary

> Thinking patterns as executable code

## Coming Soon

This appendix will contain Java implementations demonstrating:

- Recursive thinking as recursive algorithms
- Systems thinking as dependency graphs
- First principles as abstraction layers
- Metacognition as self-modifying code
- Analogical thinking as design patterns
- Critical thinking as validation logic
- Creative thinking as generative algorithms
- Strategic thinking as optimization functions

Each implementation includes:
- Full working code
- Philosophical commentary
- Cross-domain connections
- Practice exercises

**Status**: Planned for future development

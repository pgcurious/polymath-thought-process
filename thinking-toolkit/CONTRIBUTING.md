# Contributing to The Thinking Toolkit

Thank you for your interest in contributing to "The Thinking Toolkit: A Polymath's Guide to Mastering 35+ Ways to Think"!

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Real-World Examples
Share examples of thinking types in action from your domain:
- Software engineering case studies
- Neuroscience applications
- Philosophical insights
- Business scenarios
- Teaching experiences
- Personal experiments

### 2. Cross-Domain Connections
Found a pattern we haven't mentioned? Discovered how a thinking type appears in an unexpected domain? Share it!

### 3. Code Examples
Contribute implementations in other languages:
- Python, Rust, Haskell, JavaScript, Go, etc.
- Include philosophical commentary
- Show how the code embodies the thinking pattern

### 4. Experiments
Tried one of our 100 experiments? Share your results:
- What worked
- What didn't
- Modifications you made
- Insights gained

### 5. Corrections and Clarifications
Found an error? Something unclear? Let us know:
- Technical inaccuracies
- Neuroscience updates
- Philosophical misrepresentations
- Sanskrit translation corrections
- Broken links or references

### 6. Additional Resources
Know of great resources we should include?
- Books
- Papers
- Videos
- Courses
- Tools

### 7. Historical Polymath Profiles
Research on polymaths we haven't covered?
- Biography
- Their thinking patterns
- Cross-domain contributions
- Lessons for modern polymaths

## How to Contribute

### For Minor Changes
1. Open an issue describing the change
2. We'll discuss and approve
3. Submit a pull request

### For Major Contributions
1. Open an issue first to discuss
2. Get feedback on approach
3. Submit PR with changes

### For New Content
1. Follow the existing style and structure
2. Include cross-domain perspectives
3. Add exercises and questions
4. Cite sources appropriately

## Style Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Dense but accessible**: Respect reader intelligence
- **Cross-domain**: Show patterns in 3+ domains when possible
- **Practical**: Include exercises and experiments
- **Cited**: Reference sources for scientific claims
- **Polymath voice**: Naturally weave between domains

### Code Style
- **Production-ready**: Not pseudocode or toys
- **Well-commented**: Explain the thinking pattern
- **Philosophical**: Show how code embodies ideas
- **Tested**: Include tests where appropriate

### Formatting
- Use markdown
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Code blocks with language tags
- Tables for cross-domain comparisons
- Blockquotes for key insights

## Content Standards

### Scientific Accuracy
- Cite neuroscience research properly
- Don't overstate findings
- Distinguish hypothesis from established fact
- Update as science evolves

### Philosophical Integrity
- Represent traditions accurately
- Don't oversimplify complex concepts
- Acknowledge different interpretations
- Respect cultural origins

### Technical Correctness
- Code should compile and run
- Algorithms should be efficient
- Architecture should be sound
- Best practices should be followed

### Sanskrit and Other Languages
- Use standard transliteration (IAST)
- Provide translations
- Explain cultural context
- Don't appropriate without understanding

## What We're Looking For

### High Priority
- Real-world case studies showing multiple thinking types
- Cross-domain experiments with results
- Code examples with philosophical depth

- Historical polymath profiles

### Medium Priority
- Additional reading recommendations
- Practice exercises
- Tool and resource suggestions
- Translations to other languages

### Lower Priority
- Minor wording changes
- Formatting improvements
- Link additions

## Questions?

Open an issue with the "question" label and we'll respond promptly.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intentions
- Focus on ideas, not people
- Welcome diverse perspectives
